    Welcome to the Spreadsheet Program Help!

    This guide will help you navigate through the key features of the Spreadsheet Program,
    allowing you to make the most out of your data manipulation and analysis tasks.

    - Running the program:
        - Command line - python main.py

    - Editing Cells:
        - Simply click on any cell to select it.
        - Input direct values or formulas into the Value: entry field.
          Note: It can't be edited directly in the cell.

            - Direct values: Simply type the value (e.g., 123, Intro).
            - Formulas: Start with = and follow with the formula (e.g., =A1+B2).
              The program supports basic arithmetic operations +, -, *, /, %, **.

    - Selecting Cells:
        - To select a cell, simply click on it within the table.
          The selected cell will be highlighted, and its data will be
          displayed in the "Cell Data" section on the right side of the operation frame.

        - Upon selection, the cell's address (e.g., A1, B2) will automatically fill
          the last clicked entry among "Start Cell", "End Cell", "Target Cell" or "Value".

        - Value Entry - Appending Cell Addresses:
            - If the "Value" entry was the last selected before clicking on a cell,
              the program appends the clicked cell's address to the current content
              of the "Value" entry. This feature is especially useful for creating
              formulas that involve multiple cells.

                - For example, if the "Value" entry already contains =A1 and you click
                  on cell B2, the entry will update to =A1B2.
                  So if yoy want To make arithmetic operations between few cells,
                  just add the relevant operator before clicking the next cell.

                - If the "Value" entry is empty or doesn't start with =,
                  clicking on a cell will start a new formula in the "Value" entry
                  with the clicked cell's address, prefixed with =.

    - Using Cell Data:
        - The "Cell Data" display on the right side of the operation frame shows
          the current value or formula of the selected cell.

        - For cells with formulas, the formula itself (e.g., =A1+B2) is shown.
          For cells with direct values, the value is displayed as is.

    - Formulas:
        - Start formulas with '='. Example: '=A1+B2'.

    - Operations:
        - Choose an operation from the dropdown list to perform various actions
          like setting values, calculating sums, averages, maximum, minimum values,
          and counting numeric cells.

        - Specify the Start Cell and End Cell to define the range of cells the operation
          will apply to.

    - Undo:
        - To perform an undo, simply click the "Undo" button on the operation frame.
          If the undo action is possible (if there is a previously saved state to revert to),
          the spreadsheet will immediately reflect the reverted state to the last time that
          an execution made.

        - The ability to undo is dependent on the availability of previously saved states.
          If you've just started a new session and haven't made any changes yet,
          or if you've reached the limit of saved states that the program can store,
          the undo option may be temporarily unavailable.

    - Changing Column Widths
        - If a value longer than the width of the column is entered,
          the column will automatically expand accordingly.

        - To adjust the width of columns manually, navigate to Edit > Column Width

    - Legal Inputs:
        - Cell addresses should be in the format of A1, B2,..., AA1, up to SF500.
        - Maximum sheet size is 500x500.

        - For formulas, ensure to start with = followed by the expression.
          Use cell addresses within your formulas to reference specific cells.

    - Loading and Saving Sheets:
        - Use the 'File' menu to load or save your spreadsheet.

    - Recover File
        - Use the 'File' menu to recover the last Spreadsheet that was open.

    - Clearing the Sheet
        - To clear the entire sheet, select File > Clear Sheet.
